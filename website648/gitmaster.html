									<p>My name is Kevin Chan and I am the GitHub Master for Team 04. I am also a senior at SFSU and will be graduating in Spring 2021 with a B.S. in Computer Science.</p>
									<p>I live in Concord which is in the East Bay  so when I commute it takes about 3 hours round trip which really sucks, I preferably llike to drive out than take Bart since it can get hectic sometimes. I've spent the last 7 years in college as well as working, my first 3-4 years in college I didn't know what I wanted to major in and my main focus at the time was to work on my social skills with people and to get as much social exposure as possible but I eventually realized I was taking way too long and in the last 4 years I got onto declaring my major as Computer Science. I've always liked doing computer related stuff since I was a kid, I found it fascinating mainly because of video games as well as installing and removing parts in a computer. As soon as I took my first computer science course, I really liked it especially out of all the different classes that I took back at my community college.</p>
									<p>My hobbies outside of computer related stuff includes doing car stuff whether it's changing out parts or going on spirited drives, I also like to go on hikes with friends on the weekends, I'm currrently building an AR-15 for home defense pruposes and just to have some fun at the range, another thing I hope to get into is FPV drones and my goal with that is to get good at flying them so I can make cool videos.</p>
